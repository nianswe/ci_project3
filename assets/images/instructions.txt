 Gomoku is an old Japanese word for noughts and crosses chess as a board game.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
 -  The rules of the game must be the same for both black and white (noughts
    and crosses, or O and X).

 -  However, winning requires exactly 5 in a row. 6 in a row is therefore not
    a win for either player, but it is not forbidden to put 6 in a row.

  - For the game to be serious, an equalization of the advantages for black
    (who starts the game) is required, and this equalization is done only by
    means of an opening rule, by equalizing the advantages for black by the 
    possibility for a player to change sides (swap) from white to black or vice
    versa.
  
  - Swap: The starting player puts out the first three moves, i.e. 2 moves
    for black and 1 move for white anywhere on the board (game board).
    Then the opposing player can choose whether he/she wants to play as
    black or as white.
  
  - The player proposing an opening then dares not choose an opening that
    is too strong for either black or white.
