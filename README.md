## Deployment
This project is deployed using Code Institute's mock terminal for Heroku.
Terminal size is changed from original 80 columns x 24 rows  to 80 columns x 40 rows for gameboard and instruction page to fit.

Steps for Deployment:
1. Fork or Clone [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nianswe/ci_project3.git)
2. Create a new Heroku app
3. Set the build packs to Python and node.js (in that order)
4. Add Config Variables 'PORT'
5. Link the Heroku app to the repository
6. Click Deploy
